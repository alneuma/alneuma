# alneuma

I am beginning software-developer currently interested in exploring different programming paradigms and the theory of computation.

## Projects

### ChesstitY

A simple CLI-chess-game written in C that spans several thousand lines of rigorously tested code, but is not yet functional.

### Online Friends Simulator

A web-app simulating an original chat-room experience using a sophisticated system of bot and human interactions; Written in HTML, CSS and Javascript.

### Primitive Recursion

A very small Haskell module, that can be used to study [primitive recursive functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primitive_recursive_function).

### Regular Languages

A Haskell module, that simulates [nondeterministic finite automations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nondeterministic_finite_automaton) and will translate between those and regular expressions. It is under active development and created to help me studying regular languages and the theory of computation.
