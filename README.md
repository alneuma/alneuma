## Projects

### [Regulang](https://github.com/alneuma/regular_languages)

**Regulang** is a Haskell module that simulates [nondeterministic finite automatons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nondeterministic_finite_automaton) and translates between those and regular expressions. It is under active development and created to help me studying [regular languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_language).

### [OFsim](https://github.com/alneuma/online_friends_simulator)

**Online-Friends-Simulator** is a web-app creating an original chat-room experience using a simple system for bot and human interactions based on a variety of parameters; Written in HTML, CSS and Javascript.

### [Chesstity](https://github.com/alneuma/chesstity)

**Chesstity** is a simple CLI-chess-game written in C which already spans several thousand lines of code but is not yet functional.
